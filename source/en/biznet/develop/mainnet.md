# BizNet MainNet

## How to Access BizNet
There are multiple ways to access the BizNet mainnet. 
One possible method is to join the mainnet as an [observer node](running_node/node.md). 
You can also use the RPC endpoints specified [here](rpc.md) to connect to the mainnet. 
RPC endpoints may be used to interact with a node directly over HTTP or websockets. 
Using RPC, you may perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, 
viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction.
RPC endpoints are also used with web wallets like [MetaMask](../wallet/tutorials/metamask.md) to connect to the BizNet mainnet.

## How to Build on BizNet
You can build deploy [smart contracts](deploy_smart_contract/remix.md), [NFTs](nft/metadata.md), 
[ERC20 Tokens](token/intoroduction.md) on the BizNet.
